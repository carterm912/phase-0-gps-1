# Carter McGee's GPS 1.1 Reflection
*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPD session?*
*Before this session I was having a bit of difficulty pushing changes to github.

*What concepts were clarified during this GPS?*
*This gps really helped me better understand how pushing and pulling from Github works. It also helped clarigy that in commit messages I should not only include the 'what' but also the 'why.' I also learned about the Git diff command which is super cool.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*
*I asked the guide (who was also my pair) a few clarifyin questions throughout the session. Specifically how some of the git commands really work and why they do what they do. Things like that.

*What still confuses you about Git?*
*I would say I am not really confused about any of the concepts any more, but I do need to work on better recalling what some of the commands are from memory and not from my cheat sheet. But I am getting better at that each day.

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*
*despite not having another student in the GPS I really enjoyed it. I found it super helpful because I got to ask all of the little clarification questions I had been wondering about and it was nice to have someone look over your shoulder while being the driver and help navigate a bit. It was also helpful because Tam would occationally ask for what a command or process we were going through really did, and it helped me understand some of the git and github commands better rather than just going by route memorization. Tam was fantastic and super helpful I would totally sign up for another GPS with her.
